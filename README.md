# Ohno-a-bot
Ohno-bot is a discord bot made in python. It has some features that i want on my server =)

This is my personal project, i'm learning python and i'm enjoying it. If you want or review my code, i'm glad to recieve your comments =)

# Some Requeriments

This requires discord.py and pyyaml.

You need to create a directory called config, in that directory you have to make a config.yaml file with this structure:

```yaml
  token:
    id: your bot token
```

That's all!
